job can have multiple steps
and conditional steps
with in step

job: flow executes steps
step: jobs are made of one or more steps
steps can be sequantial
steps can be paraller
steps can be conditional
within steps most of the task are TASKLET type. TASKLET is interface which will execute that within the scope of TTRANSACTION
one of the tasklet is CHUNK oriented tasklet
process 1M records it will process chun of data at a time till the 1M records gets processed

CHUNK id made up of ITEM
STEP

Scaling up batch processing
- Multithreaded steps
- Parallel steps
- Async itemprocessor / Async itemwriter
- Partitioning
- Remote chunking
